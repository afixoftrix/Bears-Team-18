# Bears-Team-18
Bears Team 18 is a team that spawned from the Chingu Voyage initiative.
> The Chingu Project launches collaborative learning cohorts for developers, data scientists & designers. We facilitate remote team project experiences and level-up opportunities for self-directed learners.

 It is a platform where developers, beginner and experienced alike, from all over the world  can connect and build software together. The main purpose of the platform is to learn. Teams are made based on interest similarity and time zone difference. We are one of those bad ass teams.

#### ACT 1<br />Project Setup

As the name implies, these are the series of tasks for the team set up. 

- [x] Meet your team
- [x] Set goals and expectations
- [x] brainstorm project ideas
- [ ] define your workflow
- [ ] setup your development environment
- [x] define your **MVP**(minimum viable product)

#### ACT 2<br />Development sprints

>In the Scrum method of Agile software development, work is confined to a regular, repeatable work cycle, known as a sprint or iteration.

>...

>During each sprint, a team creates a potentially shippable product increment, no matter how basic that product is. Working within the boundaries of such an accelerated timeframe, the team would only be able to build the most essential functionality.

This will be the basic structure of our sprints:

- Plan the sprint
- Start the spring
- Team standup review
- Team progress review
- Code review & merge
- Completed sprint review

#### ACT 3<br />Project Closure
