# Bears-Team-18
Bears Team 18 is a team that spawned from the Chingu Voyage initiative. It is a platform where developers, beginner and experienced alike, from all over the world  can connect and build software together. The main purpose of the platform is to learn. Teams are made based on interest similarity and time zone difference. We are one of those bad ass teams.
